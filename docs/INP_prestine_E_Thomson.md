# Particles in Pristine Environments

Pristine aerosols, Ken Carslaw, 2014. What is the background pristine air
quality. Disconnected from WHO guidelines for air quality. 
The hetrogeniety of the distribution of people and antropogenic air pollution.

*WHO* guidelines should not exceed 25 ug/m3 per 24hour. WHO standard useless due to natural sources. E.g. seasalt & dust desert and coast.

Natural background have large impact on the influence of anthropogenic aerosol forcing. No models archived the PM2.5. 

## Approach:
* CMIP6 and CMIP5 models PI-Control. 
* Approximate PM2.5 from the output in the models.
Is the existing approach valid? No reference for the pre-industrial. 
MERRA2 able to capture PM2.5 surface concentration?

The CMIP6 approximation have smaller fraction of the fine dust. MERRA2 have large fine dust fraction.
Model intercomparison to the reanalysis. Largest the positive difference over the dusty regions. 

Model underestimation mostly coming from the dust. CMIP6 models underestimate PM2.5 related to using the reference estimation.

We want to create a best case scenario.
Regions near dust sources will have high PM2.5 without any anthropogenic input. "Pristinely" polluted. 
PM2.5 is not a useful metric for good or bad air quality. Dust regions cannot achieve on clean air. 
How does the species depending on harming health? 
THe studies are done in area with strong cleaning ability in the atmosphere  

# Arctic ship emissions:

Scrubbing removing the pollution from the exhaust to the sea. Shippers use scrubbing rather than buying cleaner fuel. 
* Fuel does not affect the number of particles release. 
* The scrubbing changes the size distribution to bi-modal. No large difference between scrubbing not scrubbing. 
* Scrubber is aimed to removing sulphur. The temperature is drastically decreased by the scrubber. 
* Scrubbing reduces the critical super saturation. Scrubbed fuel help makes clouds. 

Scrubber design is not regulated. Regulations care only on NOx and sulphur. 

We should sell clean fuel.


# Looking ahead:
Large increase in BVOC
