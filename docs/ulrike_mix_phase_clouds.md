### Why do we care about mixed phased clouds?
- Radiation bias due to mixed-phase clouds in the arctic. Too much ice. 
- What is the fraction liquid water in mixed-phased clouds. 
- "Observation and models are all over the place": Large variability, processes are not represented correctly. 

## How do we get the right number of ice crystal in the clouds. Ice crystal growth

### Tool: Holographic imagery of Microscopic objects 
- Using interference patterns of the laser to count and describe the ice crystals. 
- The holography method cannot capture the smaller ice crystal, everything smaller than 60 microns are assumed to be cloud droplets.

### Observation: Discrepancy between INPs and number of ice crystals
- Primary ice production, formed by mineral dust or organic particles.
    -  Ice crystals 3 order of magnitude higher. 
- Secondary ice processes:
    * Droplet scattering
    * Ice-ice collision
    * Rime splintering 

### Can we observed secondary ice production?
**Distinguish the large ice particles from the small:**
- 100 micron corresponds to growthtime of less than two minutes.
- Small particles have formed in-situ.

**Different regimes:** In INP limited regimes; Secondary ice production causes differences on the order of 10^5^ between INP and number of ice crystals.  

#### When does SIP occur?
Hallip-Mossip process (rime splintering). 
Secondary ice production occurs over the whole temperature range. 

**Proposed Mechnisms;** Favors drizzel sized drops, that are common in the arctic under low CCN conditions. Drizzle drops together with ice crystals then your have something that can collide. Then you get a feedback loop... 

**Is it special for the arctic?** No that's not the case, seems to be happening everywhere. 

### Understanding ice crystal growth?
* Is the habits of the ice crystal important? 
    * Can tell us about the environmental condition under which different kind of ice crystal form.
* Pretty ice crytals need high super saturation, you don't get these exact shapes in nature. 
    * E.g. Columns of capped-columns. 

## Can we exploit mixed-phase clouds for local climate engineering?
Natural phenomenon; Hole punch clouds. Aircraft punching through altocumulus / stratocumulus. The plane increase the vapor pressure and decrease temperature and thus initiate the WBF process.

Modelling study showed that modification of mixed-phased clouds can bring about 1 K cooling in the arctic (extreme case). 

**Remaining questions:** How quickly does the ice crystal grow? Difficult to get realistic environmental conditions in the in lab.
The CLOUDLAB field campaign will take the lab into the field to study the growth of ice crystals in realistic conditions.
