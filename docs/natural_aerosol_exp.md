Aerosol cloud interactions is the main uncertainty in the "tug-of-war" between aerosol 
and clouds. To better constrain climate sensitivity we need to constrain the uncertainty 
in aerosol cloud interactions. 
However it is difficult to isolate the impact by aerosols because of co-variability with 
the meteorology, and therefore we need control experiments to distinguish effects.

### Natural experiments of ACI?
Natural experiments are experiments that have no involvement by the scientist. The first 
natural experiments for studying aerosol cloud interactions where shiptracks where one 
observed that in the wake of ships one would see cloud formation, because of the aerosols 
emitted from the exhaust. Since then there have been identified more candidates that can 
be used as natural aerosol experiments, like volcanoes, urban areas or power plants.   


These aerosol perturbation on clouds can be observed on different spatial and temporal 
scales. Studying ACI on different scales can target different sources aspects of ACI, for 
instance large-scale long term experiments could help us to better understand the 
aerosol forcing, while short local experiments could improve our understanding of the 
microphysics. 


### What do we learn from the natural experiments?
MODIS data collocated with continental pollution sources, show increases in the 
cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) in the polluted plumes. However CNDC increase 
does not generally affect the thickness (liquid water path) of the cloud, unless the background 
could droplets are large then the polluted plumes show an increase in the cloud water 
content and a suppression of precipitation. This would have a cooling influence 
on climate, it as leads to increase in cloud optical depth and life time, this effect has 
been relatively well documented.  

Anthropogenic aerosols as ice nucleating particles (INPs), case study of a factory 
producing cement. The plume down wind of the factory showed increased glaciation creating 
a glaciation induced clearing in the cloud deck. This left behind 
a region of increased snowfall on the ground. The presence of INPs causes nucleation of 
ice among the super cooled liquid droplets. Due to differences in saturations pressures 
between ice and liquid the ice crystal will grow at the expanse of the droplets. This can 
initiate a chain reaction generating more ice crystals through ice multiplication. This 
causes the cloud to start precipitating and eventually dissipate. Anthropogenic INP could 
have a considerable warming effect on climate through causing reduction in cloud fraction 
and cloud optical depth and ultimately the shortwave reflectance.
