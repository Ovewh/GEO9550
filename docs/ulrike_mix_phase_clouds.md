## Why do we care about mixed phased clouds?
Radiation bias due to mixed-phase clouds in the arctic. Too much ice crystals. 

What fraction liquid water of mixed-phased clouds. 

"Observation and models are all over the place": Large variablity, processes not correctly captured. 

## How do we get the right number of ice crystal in the clouds. Ice crystal growth

* Holohrapgic imager for Microsopic objects

Use interferance patterns to count the number of ice crystals. 
Cannot capture the smaller ice crystal, everything smaller than 60 microns are assumed to be cloud droplets.

Primary ice production, formed by mineral dust or organic particles.
Discrepancy between INP and the number of ice crystals. Ice crystals 3 order of magnitude higher. 
Secondary ice processes:
* Droplet scattering
* ice-ice collision
* rime splintering 

## Can we observed secondary ice production?

100 micron corresonpd to growtimes less to two minutes. Distinquish the large from the small. Small particles have formed in-situ.

Different regimes INP limited, Secondary ice production regimes 10^5 differences between INP and ice crystals.  

## When does SIP occur?
Hallip-Mossip process (rime splintering). 
Secondary ice producition occurs over the whole temperature range. 

Mechnisms: Want drizzel sized drops, that are common in the arctic ude to low CCN. 
Drizzle drops together with ice crystals then your have something that can collide. Then you get a feedback loop... 

Is it special for the arctic?
No that's not the case, seems to be happening everywhere. 

## Understanding ice crystal growth?
Is the habits of the ice crystal important? 

Time to grow get hexagonal shapes, pretty ice crytals need high super saturation. 

You don't get these exact shapes in nature. 

Columns of capped-columns. 

## Can we exploit mixed-phase clouds for local climate engineering

Hole punch clouds. Air crafts punching through altocumulus / stratocumulus. The
plane increase the vapor pressure / decrease temperatrue, initiate the WBF
process.

about 1 K cooling in the arctic. From modelling study. How quickly does the ice
crystal grow. Difficult to get realistic environmental conditions in the in lab.
Cloud lab bring the lab into the arctic.
