# Atmospheric aerosols, acidity and impacts

*Speaker Athanasios Nenes*

## Why aerosols?
* premature deaths because of particulate matter. What is the drivers?
* Aerosols and climate CCN and black carbon,
* Modulating the properties of clouds --> precipitation climate etc.
* Biogeochemistry, bringing neutrients to ecosystems. 

What is pH of the aerosols ? 
- Acidiy aerosols are abundant. 

Why do we care?
- Chanegs in atmospheric chemisty 
- Toxity
- pH affects everything.

What controls acidity?
Inorganics only: 
- Nitrate, sulphate, animoia etc.

Clouds vs Aerosols
Stuff desolves in the clouds.

Aerosols are in chemical equlibrium with gas phase. 

Semi-volatile vs always particles.

More dust sea-salt less adicity? 

We cannot measure particle pH really diffcult. can only measure cloud pH. 
Measured using proxies. Ion balance very uncertain. 
Molar ratios neither always correlated with pH. 

## We need another approach?
Using models, allow the models to calculate we cannot measure. Need water and H+. 
Partitoning is very sensitive to pH. Getting the partition right the pH is right!
Predicting partition correctly means that the aerosol model get the pH right. 
Amizing closure between model and partitioning. 

Infere pH between 1-1.5 more adic than the batter acid. Nitric acid is semi volitiale. is the reason why we use amonia partitioning 

## pH globally

pH variaes a lot, very acid in US and Europe mixed and Asia more neutral. 

Suplhate becomes more acid when you reduce emissions. 
Don't need to worry about new nitrate. 
Volitility is the main driver of acidity

More suilable metals --> more oxidative stress. Very bad from health.

Explain different between lab and human studies of the toxity of sulphate. 

Soilable metal also becomes able for bio geo chemistry, thus it is perhaps good for the enviroment.  

Natrate in gas depositt quickly, nitrate aerosols drydeposition is slow.
