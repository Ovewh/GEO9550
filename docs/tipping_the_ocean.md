AMOC: Multiscale flow, variability across many different time scales. 
* The problem; The AMOC is showing signs of slowing down. Is the AMOC heading for collapse? 

## What is the AMOC?
Strength on average about 18 Sv. We continuously measure and monitor the sonal meridional flow of the AMOC. The strength was declining until 2014 and now seems to be restoring a bit. 

### Role of buoyancy fluxes in the AMOC:
Heat going inn at the equator and evaporation, at the pole freshwater increase, heat going out. 
Temperature and density driven flow, works opposite of the salinity driven flow. 

**Classical theory; Stommel model --> Bifurcation:**
- Multiple stable states of the regime temperature / salinity driven states.
- Salt-Advection feedback; The salinity feedback usually win giving a spinn 
  down of the circulation changing the state. As soon you get the meridional 
  velocity response the feedback happens.  


## AMOC model Hierarchy

1. Box models, low dimensional up to 10 degrees of freedom
2. 1D models, 10^2 
3. 2D models, 10^3
4. 3D models, 10^6
5. Climate models and ESMs 10^10

**Which models exhibit the stommel behavior?**
* Not the CMIP6 models? Harder to find. Weakening not collapse.
* Absence of evidence should not be taken as the absence of the phenomena


## Can we establish whether there are multiple states from present day observation?
**Finding regime indicators**:
- AMOC export salt SE-regime vs AMOC export freshwater ME-Regime. 

### Are the models in the right regime? 
- Observation indicate that AMOC is in the multistable regime. 
- Models show the opposite regime exporting salt. Due to too much evaporation 
  at the equator. AMOC in the CMIP6 is too stable and will never got to the other state.
- The high resolution models are not enormously better.
