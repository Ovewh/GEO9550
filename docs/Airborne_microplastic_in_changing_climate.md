## Microplastics: What is it?
Microplastics are particles between 1 - 5000 &mu;m of synthetic plastic. 
Microplastics mostly exists as fragments or fibers. 
In total there is estimated 5 Trillion plastic pieces around 
in the ocean weighing over 250,000 Tons. 
The first studies on microplastics in the atmosphere in the 2016, 
measuring atmospheric deposition. And found a fallout rate of microplastics between 2 
and 355 microplastics m^-2 day-1. Providing the initial estimates of microplastics
fallout between 3 and 10 tons. Thus until recently we have known very little about
the impact of atmospheric microplastics.  

## Sampling Microplastics in remote regions.
First attempt looking at airborne microplastics in New Zealand, sampling in the UC 
campus. Low deposition fluxes in the rural area of Christchurch,compared to other 
studies of microplastics in megacities. 
However currently limited to plastic particles larger than 50 mu. Thus missing out the 
small size ranges that can potentially have large number concentrations.

Modelling of microplastics in the new zealand southern alps. Collecting microplastics at 
Mt John Observatory at different sampling frequency. Turns out there is larger 
deposition rate in when using a shorter sampling period of 24-hour period compared to 1 
week periods.  Model simulations with FLEXPART-WRF gave reasonably good agreement with 
observed deposition fluxes. According to the model the main sources would be Seaspray 
and road dust.

## But are there implications for climate????? 
Need to know the Optical properties of microplastics and the emissions. 
Collections of microplastics concentration from different studies based on composition 
spectroscopy to estimate what the global atmospheric microplastics concentration could 
look like. 

How to account for the diversity of shapes? Fragments approximated to be spherical and 
thus optical properties can be computed using mie theory. 
Fibers are more complex and therefore optical properties are obtained from using 
raytracing simulations. Refractive indices was not possible to obtain for colored 
polymers.  

### What is the ERF?
If assumed global uniform concentration of 1 MP m-3 taking into account that remote 
regions have very small amount of microplastics there is no signal from 
microplastics. Scaled to 100 MP m-3, which is the mean the studies that where included 
(representative mainly of urban cities). 
There is a very small radiative forcing by microplastics of about 0.7 mW m-2. 

**Uncertainties?**
- Concentrations; higher concentration in megacities. 
- Bias assiociated with the different sampling metods. 
- Vertical distribution 

Indirect microplastics cloud effects? Some characteristics to act as INP and CCN.But 
there are large knowledge gaps here. 

In conclusion lot of plastics end up in the environment, microplastics will be 
created even if we stop using plastics today. Thus we need to understand the 
impact it has on the environment and climate.
