The MOSAIC expedition from September 2019 to October 2020 was the most comprehensive measurement 
campaign ever conducted in the arctic. The motivation of the MOSAIC campaign was to provide  
provide measurements of is happening in arctic in under climate climate change, a region have not 
been measured. The research ship Polarstern spent one year frozen into the arctic sea ice. During 
the campaign a large collection of measurements of atmospheric properties and 
composition were performed. 

To help interpret these measurement backtrajetory simulations using the FLEXPART lagrangian 
particle dispersion model performed. Simulations where performed every 3 hour starting from the 
location of the ship and traveling backward 30 days. The information from all trajectories can be 
synthesized in to create a sensitivity maps. The sensitivity maps is based on the amount of time 
each trajectory spend in each cell, the more time the trajectories spend over one grid cell the 
more sensitive is the receptor to emissions there. The sensitivity can be coupled with different 
emissions to create maps of the sources contributing to the different tracers at the ship. 

### Result of the MOSAIC campaign. 

The year of the MOSAIC campaign was year with the Arctic oscillation in the

Emissions senstivity below 100m 

 2020 was an exceptional year with respect to the AO. Negative AO inhibits transport from the lower latitudes. Arctic haze.

 Summer you can have new particle formation. When transport from continental region you have more aerosols.
