# Tipping of the Atlantic Ocean Circulation

AMOC: Multiscale flow, variability across many different time scales. 

* THe problem: signs of the AMOC slowing down.

AMOC may heading for collapse. 

## What is the AMOC
Strenght at average about 18 Sv. We measure and monitor the sonal meriodinal flow
of the AMOC. The strenght was declining until 2014 and now seems to be restoring
a bit. 

Role of buoyancy fluxes in the AMOC:
Heat going inn at the equator and evaporation, at the pole freshwater increase, heat going out. 

Temperature and density driven flow, works opposite of the salinity driven flow. 
* Stommel model. Bifurcation

Multiple stable states of the regime temperature / salinity driven states.

Salt-Advection feedback. The salinity feedback usually win giving a spinn down
of the circulation changing the state. As soon you get the meridional velocity
response the feedback happens.  


## AMOC model Hierarchy

* Box models, low dimensional up to 10 degrees of freedom
* 1D models, 10^2 
* 2D models, 10^3
* 3D models, 10^6
* Climate models and ESMs 10^10


Which models exhibit the stommel behavior?
* Not the CMIP6 models? Harder to find. Weakling not collapse
* Absence of evidence should not be taken as the absence of the phenomena


## Can we establish whether there are multiple states from present day observation.

Finding regime indicators. 
AMOC export salt SE-regime, AMOC export freshwater ME-Regime. 

Are the models in the right regime? 

Observation indicate that AMOC is in the multistable regime. 

Models show the oposite regime exporting salt. Due to too much evaporation at
the equator. AMOC in the CMIP6 is to stable and will never got to the other
state.

The high resolution models are not enormously better.
