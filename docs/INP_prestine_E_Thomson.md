# Particles in Pristine Environments - air quality, clouds, and human influence

The natural background of aerosols have large impact on the 
influence of anthropogenic aerosol forcing (Ken Carslaw, 2014). 
Furthermore the natural aerosol background is heterogeneous e.g. in 
the proximity of deserts the natural aerosol load exceeds the WHO 
air quality guidelines for PM2.5 of 25$\mu \mathrm{m\;m}^{-3}$ per 
24hour regardless of antropogenic influence. Therefore WHO 
guidelines are not useful target in these regions. 

## Representation of PM2.5 in CMIP climate models

* **Data**: CMIP6 and CMIP5 models PI-Control. 
* **Task**: Approximate PM2.5 from the output in the models.

The CMIP6 approximation gives a smaller fraction of the fine dust, 
compared to the MERRA2 reanalysis.Largest bias compared to the 
reanalysis over the dusty regions. 
The underestimation of PM2.5 in the CMIP models are mostly due to 
the dust.

**Investigation of best case scenario for future air quality measures:**
- Regions near dust sources will have high PM2.5 without any anthropogenic input. "Pristinely" polluted. 
- PM2.5 is not a useful metric for good or bad air quality. Dust regions cannot achieve on clean air. 
- Does the negative health effects of PM2.5 pollution depend on  aerosol species? 
- Most studies are done in areas with strong cleaning ability by the atmosphere.  

## Arctic ship emissions: Effect on cloud properties

Scrubbing removes the pollutants from the ship exhaust and releasing it as waste product in to the sea. Shippers use scrubbing rather than buying cleaner fuel, to save cost.

**Insights from marine test engine:**
* The kind fuel does not affect the number of particles release. 
* The scrubbing changes the size distribution to bi-modal. No large difference between scrubbing not scrubbing. 
* Scrubber is aimed to removing sulphur. The temperature is drastically decreased by the scrubber. 
* Scrubbing reduces the critical super saturation. Scrubbed fuel help makes clouds. 

Scrubber design is not regulated. Regulations care only on NOx and sulphur. We should sell clean fuel.
