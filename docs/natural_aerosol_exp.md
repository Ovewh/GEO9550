Aerosol cloud interactions is the main uncertainty in the "tug-of-war" between aerosol and clouds. To better constrain climate sensitivty we need to constrain the uncertaintiy in aerosol cloud interactions. 
However it is difficult to isolate the impact by aerosols because of covariability with the meteorology, and therefore we need control experiments to distinguish effects.

### Natural experiments of ACI?
Natural experiments are experiments that have no involvent by the scientist. The first natural experiments for studying aerosol cloud interactions where shiptracks where one observed that in the wake of ships one would see cloud formation, because of the aerosols emmited from the exhaust. Since then there have been identified more candidates that can be used as natural aerosol experiments, like volcanoes, urban areas or power plants.   

These aerosol pertubation on clouds can be observed on different spatial and temporal scales. Studying ACI on different scales can target different sources apects of ACI, for instantace large-scale long term experiments could help us to better understand the aerosol forcing, while short local experiments could improve our understanding of the microphysis. 


### What do we learn from the natural experiments?
MODIS data and collocation with continental pollution sources, show increases in the cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) in the polluted plumes does not affect the thickness (liqud water path) of the cloud. However if the background could droplets are large then the poluted plumes show an increase in the cloud water content and resulting in a precipitation supression.  

Antropogenic aerosols as ice nucleating particles (INPs). Case study of a factory producing cement, where the plume down wind of the factory shows increased glaciation and causing the formation of glaciation induced clearning in the cloud deck. This left behind a region of increased snowfall on the ground. The presence of INPs causes  nucleation of ice among the super cooled liquid droplets. Due to differences in saturations pressures between ice and liquid the ice crystal will grow at the expanse of the droplets. This can initiate a chain reaction generating more ice crystals through ice multiplication. This causes the cloud to start precipitating and eventually dissapate. Antropogenic INP could have a considerable waming effect on climate through causing reduction in cloud fraction and cloud optical depth and utimately the shortwave reflectance.
