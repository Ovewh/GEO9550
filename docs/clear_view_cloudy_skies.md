Want to get the fluxes of TOA radiation right. Global mean is good because we
usually tune them to be so. However we does typically do not the get regional
fluxes correct, due to cloud biases.

* Small progress since CMIP3 and CMIP5. The systemic error are of ten the same.
  Large part of the ocean are too reflective.

ECWMF "climate model" 80km vs ECMWF day-1 model 9km annual mean. Have much of
the same systematic errors. Not corrected by the assimilation. 

How much of the errors are due to clouds. Most of the errors are due to clouds, except snow albedo errors in the himalayas.

The bias have improved over the last two decade. 

Does the ECWMF model have aerosols included. 

## How do we diagnose and reduce the systematic errors in cloud and radiation.  
Structural vs Parametric errors? 

Why does it matter?
* Southern Ocean SW bias produces SST bias in the Ocean. 
* Hemispheric albedo, Southern hemisphere albedo is close to northern hemisphere. 
* Climate sensitivity. 

Not reflective enough in the cold air outbreak regions. Too little water according to microwave sounder remote sensing. 
Too little super cooled liquid water. Errors in the convection scheme.

Error reduced through improved storm tracks. 

### Example 2: Stratocumuls and trade-cumulus

Albedo does not vary much through over the MAGIC ship track. 
Correcting LWP from MODIS using offline radiation model. Most of the error is the LWP.
Model pretty good in trade cumulus, but not so well in the stratocumulus.
Effective radius further improve stratocumulus regions. 
Heterogeneity correction further improve the stratocumulus region. 

IFS 47r3 significantly improved the errors in the trade cumulus regions. 

Subgrid hetrogeniety. 
Closed cell convection in the IFS, but open-cell in observation.

Is it resolution?
Getting smaller scale structure but the problems is still there. 

# Conclusion

Potential for assimilation of visible reflectances. Is the IFS reflectance good enough?

Error common across the NWP and Climate models. Improvement in NWP which are close to observations can be used to diagnose the errors and then feed upto the climate models.
