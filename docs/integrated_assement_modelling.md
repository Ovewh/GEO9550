# Using simple integrated assessment models ot explore human and earth system feedbacks.

FELIX model. Landuse and diatary changes. IAM are complex models of land-ecomomy-climate system using socioecominic assumptions to produces energy land use and emissions scenarios. -> Models used in IPCC assesment. 

Cost-benefit IAMs, COst-effectiveness IAMs 

Process based IAMs: Represent drives of cliamte changes, land use and energy systems. No cost minimazations. 


World trans transparent assessment for Real people. 

Weakness:

- Weak representation of social , ahuma and ecomomiuc heteorgeney. 
- Limited representation of feedbacks between human and nature. 

Emilator simplified versions of ESM and Cliamte models, heavility parameterized. Can run many senarious in a computationally cheap way. 

Simple models in also emergingin in social economic modelling. Simple models comes with large transparencies. THey can explore the uncertainties sinces they have low compuational cost. Larger stakeholder engagement. Explore results in Real time. 


## System dynamics.
Descriptive model. No cost-minimizing etc.
Based on core concepts of system thinking: 
 - stocks flows delays abd feedback loops. 

Time-continous, drynaci behaviour created by feedbacks.
No descrete events. The time event comes only when you build the model and solve it  

Only ODE --> makes the models super efficient. 

Lead to transparency and cost efficient. 

Modelling of golbal social changes. --> calibrate and validate social science phenomena. Modelling humans. 
System dynamic makes it easy to related model behaviour to the structuree. giving cognitevely grounded insights. 

Flexibility to expand modle boundaries and capture wider feedbakc mechanisism.s

Ability to rapidly simulate the mfro auncerinty analysis and 

Macro level societal trends such as digitalixation, algorithmins makes decisions for us. Now we become categorized in some social segments.

**The limits to growth? World model.**

## The FeliX model
Capture feedbacks between different models. Societal change for low-carbon consumption. Diatary change and land use change. 

Land use in FLElix model. Forect, Agricultural urban and instducstiral and orther land. 

Feedback mechanisms. Land is used to create food, food demand is controlled by the population. Pressure use more fertilizer og create more aridable land through deforestation. Crop yeild and agricultural give the total food supply. GDP is the main driver of food demand. 

What you eat also affect the food demand. The FLEXI model have 8 different food types. Diatary changes determine the food demand. 
Land pressure create fertilizer comsumption.

Instead of a small part of the population following a vegean diatle, we need a healty diet, some meat.

Socore the model input in therms of the what is most influencial, social norms is the most important.  

Usefullness is the most important craterions of validity.
